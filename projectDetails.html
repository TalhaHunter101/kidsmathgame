    <h3 style="padding: 10px;" class="fas fa-h3"  >Design Requirement: </h3> <br>
    <p style="padding: 10px; "class="fa fa-paragraph" aria-hidden="true">User wants to play the game, since our desired product is for the kids that are from age bracket (2-5) i am assuming that they are not able to directly navigate through the internet browser to reach our website, here came the role of there guardian (specially Mother) he/she will open the browser and type the Educational kids for kids under age 05 and reach to our website.
        Here after the selection of the complexity level the user will directly land into the play area.
        Once the start button is hit, the game will start, the timer will be set and the music will be played in the background.
        Different mathematical sums(related to basic arithmetics ,addition ,subtraction,multiplication, division) will come one by one after the user has solved and typed the answer for the presented question .Until the timer has reached its limit.
        The user will then be notified by the number of correctly answered sums and wrongly attempted questions.

        <h5>Unstructured - Definition of Problem Situation</h5>
        Our definition of the problem would be to make the interface more interactive for kids and introduce a difficulty level for appropriate problems. Add some color to alleviate the bland style of the site.
       
       <h5>Detailed - Definition of Problem Situation</h5> 
        In the second step, we try to describe the problem situation more effectively and in detail, in our problem definition would be that currently the menu for selection should be highlighted and easy to understand. Along with the introduction of a timer and interface for a more prominent view of the screen. 
        <h5>Root Definition of System</h5>
        Next comes the root definition where we move from the real world to a step that defines the purpose of the system. In our case it can fall in the domain of children's education through interactive means through which kids of a particular age group can learn Maths.
        <h5>Conceptual Models</h5>
        In the fourth step conceptual models are devised, such that they explain what steps are needed to achieve what is being proposed in the previous step. In our case we are trying to modify and customize the existing site to make it more user friendly according to their age group and introduce new features.
        <h5>Comparison of Conceptual Models with Real World Problems</h5>
        In the comparison of the actual system with the conceptual model we can devise the learning process of the child and their preferences according to their levels. Because the initial site we have selected is bland for kids user our focus is also on the interface improvement.
       <h5> Determine Possible and Feasible Changes</h5>
        Feasible changes we found in light of our project audience is to introduce illustrations and music in the site along with the introduction of basic features like timer and score on the main screen. We can change the layout to improve learnability and robustness.
        <h5>Identify Actions Required for Changes</h5>
        The actions will be first a web designer will design a web page layout that will be engineered to assist the user landing a page with certain instructions to lead. A web developer will try to customize the proposed solutions into interactive websites along with some new features.
